Welcome to my **JavaScript basics project**, a series of exercises designed to practice fundamental concepts of JavaScript. This project was done as part of **The Hacking Project (THP)**.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to reinforce your knowledge of **variables, loops, arrays, functions, and basic algorithms** in JavaScript.  

You will find **7 exercises**, each implemented in its own script file:

| `script_1.js` | Hello World and personalized greeting using `prompt()` |
| `script_2.js` | Factorial calculation using loops |
| `script_3.js` | Build a right-aligned Mario-style pyramid |
| `script_4.js` | Filter, map, and sort an array of entrepreneurs |
| `script_5.js` | Analyze a library of books (filter, find, sort) |
| `script_6.js` | Simplified genetic code translator (ARN → amino acids) |
| `script_7.js` | Acne-bot chatbot responding to user input |
